## Emotech ML tasks for interviews
---

This is a tiny code repo for DNN-related ML tasks used when interviewing.

### How to start the test

To start checking the test, please:

1. Run `python setup.py install` to install `mlp` module, which is going to be used through the tasks.

2. Install other python dependencies;

3. open this directory and run `./start.sh`, which will run the notebook via `iPython`.

4. Candidates can then check the notebook for more detailed instructions.

### Submission

Candidates are expected to compress the repo and send it back to the one who sent the task.

The answer file can be in various forms (.pdf, .txt, .ipynb etc) but please ensure that:

1. Each question has been answered clearly and indexed;

2. For each question, associated code has been included in either snippets or code blocks in the notebook.

3. Equations have been formatted and properly aligned using Latex (https://latex.wikia.org/wiki/Align_(environment)).
